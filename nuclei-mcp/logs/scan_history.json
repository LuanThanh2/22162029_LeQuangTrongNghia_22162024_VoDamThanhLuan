These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized database access. Recommendations: Implement prepared statements with parameterized queries, enforce strict input validation, and use web application firewalls (WAFs).\n\n2. **Local File Inclusion (LFI) & Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Medium/Critical Severity)**: LFI vulnerabilities were detected with attempts to access sensitive files like /etc/passwd. RCE was verified with commands like 'whoami'. Recommendations: Disable dynamic file inclusion, implement strict file path validation, and restrict server permissions.\n\n3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Low Severity)**: Several XSS vectors were identified. Recommendations: Implement output encoding, use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers, and sanitize all user inputs.\n\n4. **Broken Access Control (BAC) (Low Severity)**: Unauthorized access to admin areas was detected. Recommendations: Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC), enforce authentication checks, and restrict sensitive endpoints.\n\n5. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (Low Severity)**: Potential CSRF vulnerabilities were found in forms. Recommendations: Implement anti-CSRF tokens and enforce same-site cookie attributes.\n\n6. **Sensitive Data Exposure (Low Severity)**: Exposed sensitive information in API responses and error messages. Recommendations: Disable detailed error messages in production, implement proper logging without sensitive data, and use encryption for sensitive data.\n\n7. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (Low Severity)**: Potential IDOR vulnerabilities were detected. Recommendations: Implement proper authorization checks and use indirect object references.\n\nGeneral Recommendations:\n- Prioritize fixing critical SQLi and RCE vulnerabilities first.\n- Conduct a thorough code review focusing on input validation and output encoding.\n- Update all frameworks and libraries to their latest secure versions.\n- Implement regular security testing and monitoring.\n- Consider engaging a professional penetration testing service for a comprehensive assessment."
